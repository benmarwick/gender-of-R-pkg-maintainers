# Genders of R Package Maintainers

View the results here: https://benmarwick.github.io/gender-of-R-pkg-maintainers/cran-gender.html

Here is a quick look at the gender ratios of R package maintainers, and how that has changed over time, 
and how it compares to the R Foundation membership. I did this analysis in 2014, motivated by the 
“Conversation about R’s Gender Gap: The useR! her Panel” at the UseR meeting (http://user2014.stat.ucla.edu/). 
A recent discussion amongst Jennifer Bryan, Hadley Wickham, and Erin LeDell on twitter where it was 
noted that only one contributor to R core is a woman, further prompted me to pursue it 
(https://twitter.com/JennyBryan/status/544970521348034561).

Here’s what I’ve done. First, I looked at the overall counts and ratio of genders of R 
package maintainers. I found that roughly 15% are women. Second, I had a brief look to 
see how this has changed over time. I found that the proportion of women maintainers 
has actually been dropping slightly in recent years. Third, I looked to see how the 
ratio of genders of R package maintainers, as a proxy for the R user community, is 
reflected by the R Foundation, as an entity representing users and leading the R Project. 
I found, as most R users probably know, that the R Foundation is all male, but it should 
have at least three women on the list to adequetely represent active R developers. I 
recommend some specific R developers to add to the R Foundation to improve the effectiveness 
of the Foundation as a group acting in the interests of R Project and its developers and users.
